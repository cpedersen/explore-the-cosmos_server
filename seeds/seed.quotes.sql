    ('4', 'Carl Sagan', 'One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we 
tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the 
truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, 
that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.');

    everyone you have ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives...[E]very king and peasant, 
    every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every revered teacher of morals, 
    every corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived 
    there–on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.”');
